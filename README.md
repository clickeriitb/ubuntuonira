Linux on IRA
============

Recently WishTel launched an IRA 10' inch tablet in the market. Our main motive was to run linux on top of it.

We were able to accomplish two objectives:

a) Were able to run successfully Fedora 18 through external SD card.

b) were able to boot ubuntu 12.04 within android itself.
